Additionally, indiegame.co reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by indiegame.co or indiegame.co’s partners and contractors.

indiegame.co may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on indiegame.co’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by indiegame.co. These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. indiegame.co may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. indiegame.co has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for indiegame.co.

Data retention. 
indiegame.co retains the data collected pursuant to this Section for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Section unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Section, indiegame.co will delete all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe. Irrespective of the above, indiegame.co may still retain some of the data to the extent such retention is necessary to resolve disputes, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Game.

You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Game.
 
Severability and Survival. 
If any provision of this License is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision shall be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this License shall continue in full force and effect.
 
Injunctive Relief. 
You agree that a breach of this License may cause irreparable injury to indiegame.co for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and indiegame.co shall be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law.
You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Game or any indiegame.co game, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of the Game or any content or other material used or displayed through the Game and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages, limited by Section 5 (if any).

In the event of a conflict between a translation of the indiegame.co Policies and the English version, the English version of the indiegame.co Policies will prevail.
 
No Waiver.

The express waiver by indiegame.co of any provision, condition, or requirement of this License shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
